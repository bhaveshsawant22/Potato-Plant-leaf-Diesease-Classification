# Potato-Plant-leaf-Diesease-Classification

A deep learning-based method for accurately classifying potato illnesses is implemented in this repository. Utilizing cutting-edge convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained on an extensive collection of photos of potato plants with a range of illnesses.

Important characteristics:
1. Deep Learning Model:
   For high-precision disease categorization, it makes use of a CNN architecture.
3. Dataset:
   A carefully selected collection of pictures of various potato plants with disease labels attached.
5. Training: Easily understood and repeatable code that includes augmentation and preprocessing of data for model training.
6. Inference: Use the trained model to make inferences on fresh photos of potato plants in real-time or in batches.
